We've been hard at work improving and adding new feature to the application. Here's what's new:

*Mew Features*

**Local SOPs**
- You can now write your local SOPs directly in Somari.
- Drive and PDF export also available.

**Security Strategy**
- You can now write your security strategy document, both at country and site levels, directly in Somari.
- Drive and PDF export also available.
- You can navigate between country and site documents with ease.

**Context Analysis**
- You can now write _country level_ context analysis documents.
- Drive and PDF export also available.
- You can navigate between country and site documents with ease.

**Security Level**
- You now have a country-wide overview of the security level of each site.

*Improvements*

**Evacuation Plan**
- We've added a tab to the Evacuation Plan. In the tab called "Evacuation Plan" you can now write a comprehensive document as you would with MS Word. As usual you can export it to PDF and add files to the Drive.
- In the Itineraries tab we have now added markers to clarify where the start (A) and end (B) of the itinerary is.
