The breadcrumb is located at the top of every page and serves two basic purposes:

- Tell you where you are
- Allow you to navigate back where you came from

We've just made it so the last item of the breadcrumb, indicating which page you currently viewing, a little bigger to attract more attention and help you find that important information.
