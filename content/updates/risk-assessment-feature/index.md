Although each context is unique, organizations need to compare, in some aggregated way, the level of security of each site of operation. This is done by setting the Security Level of a site.

This feature is implemented as follows:

- Score a set of indicators from 1 to 5. Each level has a description in order to increase consistency of ranking across countries and sites.
- Indicators are grouped in categories.
- Both indicators and categories are customizable.
- Give the site an overall score (from 1 to 5). The security manager manually aggregates the score of all indicators to account for context specificities.

Watch the video below for a full demo of the feature.
