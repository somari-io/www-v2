We have added the ability to browse [HDX Signals](https://centre.humdata.org/introducing-hdx-signals/) from within Somari! We're continuing to make it the one-stop-shop for all things SRM.

If you missed it, Signals is a service that monitors key datasets and generates automated emails when significant, negative changes are detected.
