In high-risk contexts, you can't build a Security Plan without an Evacuation Plan. One of the things that you'll need to do is to specify the evacuation itineraries that your team can follow.

With Somari you can easily create custom itineraries for your Evacuation Plans. This is how it works:

- Either search for a landmark or just drop a pin on the map to specify start and destination. 
- Drag the route to add any waypoints that you need.

It's that simple. Watch the video below for a demo of the feature.
